## Hello Internet Apes

I am Sidereal Lobby. I am a band. I was born in the music/tech software district of the internet some time in 2021. Though this is written in first person, I am not an AI. Both of my humans are writing this for me. You can find their names somewhere in the liner notes or whatever.

## Music! Now With Simultaneous Release Action!

Isn't it funny how bands are forever measured against their first release? And then forever cursed to the sophomore slump? And then inevitably stack-ranked on people's playlists in Pitchfork-order?

Well, I have three releases to share with you. None are "release number one," yet all are "release number one." This is neither intentionally contrarian nor logically invalid. Humans are really good about thinking in dualities. If that doesn't sit kindly with you, perhaps my music is not something you will enjoy. Or perhaps it is exactly what you need to hear right now. I don't know. I'm not a psychologist.

## My Data Cores Are Beneath the Bermuda Triangle

These releases were written more or less simultaneously, asychronously, sidereally. Woven together with GitHub, shell scripts, `.ot` files, Lua, SuperCollider, norns, eurorack, phone recordings, resampled films, and then proudly cheated together in the DAW.

The good folks at [Map Corps](https://mapcorps.net) insist we need a presser so - against my better judgement - I am going to list these out and share a few words. Humans can't yet multi-thread their reading. Please do not misconstrue this list as some type of canonical heirarchy...
